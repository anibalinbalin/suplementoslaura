## ⚖️ Liability Protection

### What This System Does
✅ Flags dangerous combinations
✅ Provides evidence-based warnings
✅ Requires professional review for high-risk cases
✅ Documents decision-making process
✅ Educates users on risks

### What It Doesn't Do
❌ Replace medical diagnosis
❌ Guarantee safety (individual variability exists)
❌ Cover every possible interaction
❌ Provide personalized medical advice

### Legal Disclaimer Still Required
**Always include**:
> "This tool provides educational information only and does not constitute medical advice. Consult a qualified healthcare professional before starting any supplement regimen, especially if you have medical conditions or take medications."

## 🎓 For Your Team

### If You Hire Developers
Show them:
- `lib/clinical-safety.ts` - All clinical data
- `lib/safety-validator.ts` - Validation logic
- `lib/__tests__/manual-safety-test.ts` - How to test

### If You Expand Clinical Coverage
To add a new supplement contraindication:

```typescript
// In lib/clinical-safety.ts
export const CONTRAINDICATIONS: Record<string, Contraindication> = {
  "New Supplement Name": {
    conditions: ["condition1", "condition2"],
    medications: ["medication1", "medication2"],
    severity: "MAJOR", // or "CRITICAL"
    rationale: "Clinical explanation of why this is contraindicated",
  },
  // ...
}
```
